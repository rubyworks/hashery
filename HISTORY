= RELEASE HISTORY

== 1.2.0 // 2010-06-04

This release makes two signifficant changes to the Hashery.
First, we have a new shiny library called FuzzyHash by
Joshua Hull. It's a cool idea that allows hash keys to be
regular expressions. Secondly, OpenCascade is now a subclass
of OpenHash rather than OpenObject (to go along with the
changes of the last release), and it now support cascading
within Arrays.

Changes:

* 1 New Library

  * FuzzyHash by Joshua Hull

* 1 Major Enhancement

  * OpenCascade subclasses OpenHash and handles Array cascading.


== 1.1.0 // 2010-04-28

A follow-up release of Hashery that adds two new libraries:
Association and SparseArray. Both of these may seem like odd
entries, but they each belong in a unique way. An Association
is akin to a single entry Hash --it represents a pairing.
While a SpareArray, though compatible with the Array class,
is completely under-pinned by a Hash in order to make it
effcient when no ebtries are given for a set of indexes,
hence "sparse".

Changes:

* 2 New Libraries

  * Added association.rb
  * Added sparsearray.rb


== 1.0.0 // 2010-04-21

This is the first release of the Facets Hashery.
Most of included classes come directly from Ruby
Facets, so they have been around a while and are
in good working condition.

Some improvements are planned for the next release.
In particular the OrderHash and Dictionary, which
presently have essentially the same coding, will
diverge to target slightly different use cases.

Changes:

* Happy Birthday!
